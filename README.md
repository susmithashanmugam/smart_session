SmartSession – Real-Time Student Engagement & Proctoring System

SmartSession is a full-stack web prototype designed to help teachers understand student engagement in real time while maintaining exam integrity.
The system analyzes a student’s webcam feed using facial landmarks and provides explainable behavioral insights to a teacher dashboard.

This project avoids black-box emotion models and instead uses rule-based computer vision logic, making it transparent, ethical, and suitable for education environments.
